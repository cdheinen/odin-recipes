    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The best salmon cakes have just the right amount of onion, bell pepper, and parsley, are lightly seasoned with Dijon, Worcestershire, and Old Bay, and held together with just enough panko breadcrumbs. They fry up crisp and tender.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely chopped red onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped celery</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teapsoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 2/3 cups panko breadcrumbs, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups flaked cooked salmon (about 3/4 pound)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, let cool slightly, and add to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add parsley, Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, Worcestershire, Old Bay, egg, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and mix until well combined. Stir in 2/3 cup bread crumbs until moistened. Fold in salmon and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add remaining breadcrumbs to a shallow dish. Form salmon mixture into 6 balls. Roll each ball in breadcrumbs to cover completely; gently flatten balls into patties.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half patties to skillet and cook, turning once, until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer patties to prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining patties.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
